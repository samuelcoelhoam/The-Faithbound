# The-Faithbound
Not all faith is blind. Not all betrayal is invisible. — **The Faithbound**, a strategic investigation game for **Apple TV** and **iPhone**, built with Swift/SwiftUI and powered by **Multipeer Connectivity** for seamless multi-device interaction. <br>

### About
Welcome to the world of The Faithbound — a local multiplayer experience designed to transform the way people play together. By combining the shared screen of the Apple TV with the personal interface of the iPhone, the game creates a tense, collaborative, and highly strategic environment where every action matters. <br>

In this asymmetric social game, the Apple TV provides the main view of the cult’s progress, rituals, events, and public actions, while each iPhone acts as an interactive controller, delivering secret roles, private cards, and hidden actions. <br>

Players take on one of two roles:<br>
- Cultists: work together to expand the cult, gain followers, strengthen their faith, and play action cards to advance their cause. <br>
- The Heretic: hides among them, sabotaging the cult from within—corrupting followers, disrupting rituals, spreading distrust, and even eliminating cultists to weaken their influence.<br>

The tension rises with every turn as players act, bluff, accuse, and attempt to uncover the hidden traitor before the cult falls apart.
